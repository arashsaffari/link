# Create a symbolic link from subfolder in writable folder to public folder for Codeigniter 4



**I look forward to every help, further development and recommendation**


## install this package

```shell
$ composer require codeigniterext/link
```

or 

```shell
$ composer require codeigniterext/link:dev-master
```

Now you can use the following command:

```shell
$ php spark link:create -t uploads -l uploads_in_public
```
